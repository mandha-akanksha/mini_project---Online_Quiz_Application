## Task-8 : Mini Project - Online Quiz Application

## Objective:
I created a console-based Online Quiz Application in Java that asks multiple-choice questions, takes user input, checks answers, and displays the final score. I used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts for better structure and reusability.

## Tools Used:
- Java(JDK)
- VS Code
- Terminal
  
## Features:
- Stores multiple-choice questions with options.
- Accepts user input and validates answers.
- Shows whether the answer is correct or wrong.
- Calculates and displays the final score
- Easy to extend, just add more Question objects.
  
## Files Included:
- Question.java --> Class to store question text, options, and correct answer
- Quiz.java --> Class with quiz logic (asking questions, checking answers, scoring)
- MainApp.java â€“ Main class to run the application
  
## Steps I followed:
- Created a Question class with variables for question text, options, and correct answer index
- Created a Quiz class to store questions in an ArrayList and implement quiz logic
- In MainApp, added multiple Question objects to the quiz
- Used loops and if-else conditions to check answers and calculate score
- Displayed results at the end of the quiz
